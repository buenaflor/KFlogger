/**
 * Provides per log site state for stateful fluent logging operations (e.g. rate limiting).
 *
 * <p>A log site map allows a logging API to efficiently, and safely, retrieve mutable log site
 * state. This state can then be updated according to the current log statement.
 *
 * <p>Note that values held in this map are expected to be mutable and must still be thread safe
 * themselves (the map protects only from concurrent lookup, not concurrent modification of the
 * state itself). It is also strongly advised that all implementations of log site state avoid using
 * locking (e.g. "synchronized" data structres) due to the risk of causing not trivial and
 * potentially harmful thread contention bottlenecks during logging.
 *
 * <p>This class is intended only for use by fluent logging APIs (subclasses of {@link LogContext}
 * and only used in the {@link LogContext#postProcess(LogSiteKey)} method, which supplies the key
 * appropriate for the current log statement.
 *
 * @param <V> The value type in the map.
