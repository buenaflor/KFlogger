/**
 * Static utility methods for lazy argument evaluation in Flogger. The {@link #lazy(LazyArg)}
 * method allows lambda expressions to be "cast" to the {@link LazyArg} interface.
 *
 * <p>In cases where the log statement is strongly expected to always be enabled (e.g. unconditional
 * logging at warning or above) it may not be worth using lazy evaluation because any work required
 * to evaluate arguments will happen anyway.
 *
 * <p>If lambdas are available, users should prefer using this class rather than explicitly creating
 * {@code LazyArg} instances.

   * this mechanism and, in general, explicitly calling {@code toString()} on arguments which are
   * being logged is an error as it precludes the ability to log an argument structurally.
