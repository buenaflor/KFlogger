 * <p>Scopes are provided via the {@link Provider} interface and found by looking for
 * the current {@link com.giancarlobuenaflor.kflogger.context.ScopedLoggingContext ScopedLoggingContexts}.
 *
 * <p>Stateful fluent logging APIs which need to look up per log site information (e.g. rate limit
 * state) should do so via a {@link LogSiteMap} using the {@link LogSiteKey} passed into the {@link
 * LogContext#postProcess(LogSiteKey)} method. If scopes are present in the log site {@link
 * Metadata} then the log site key provided to the {@code postProcess()} method will already be
 * specialized to take account of any scopes present.
 *
 * <p>Note that scopes have no effect when applied to stateless log statements (e.g. log statements
 * without rate limiting) since the log site key for that log statement will not be used in any
 * maps.
